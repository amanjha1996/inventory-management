        <h5>
            In any business or organization, 
            all functions are interlinked and connected to each other
            and are often overlapping. Some key aspects like supply chain management,
            logistics and inventory form the backbone of the business delivery function. 
            Therefore these functions are extremely important to marketing managers as well as
            finance controllers.
Inventory management is a very important function that determines
the health of the supply chain as well as the impacts the financial health 
of the balance sheet. Every organization constantly strives to maintain optimum
inventory to be able to meet its requirements and avoid over or under 
inventory that can impact the financial figures.
